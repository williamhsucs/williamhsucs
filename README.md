I am a person with a passion for computer science. I am not limited to being in only one technical field. I am currently a firmware engineer, developing the next generation of commercial network switch and data center switch. I also have four years of experience as a full stack engineer, and as a team leader, I leaded the team to develop an e-commerce platform. This platform helps many stores to have their own official websites and a new way of selling. In addition, I have a year of software quality assurance engineer experience, and I know how to ensure the quality of the product from a different perspective.

For others, it is very difficult to give up familiar things. However, I like challenges and I continue to expand my abilities because I am very interested in the world of computer science. For a person who combines work and hobbies, you don't have to worry about my contribution to work.

If you are looking for someone who can lead the product to success while ensuring the technical quality of the product, I will be the person you are looking for. And I believe I would make a valuable asset to you.
